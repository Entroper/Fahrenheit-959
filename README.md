# Fahrenheit-959
This is a mod for Factorio that adjusts the steam temperature produced by heat exchangers to 515 ⁰C (959 ⁰F).

Since the base temperature of water is 15 ⁰C, the effect of this change is that water will be heated by 500 ⁰C instead of 485 ⁰C.  This makes for much nicer ratios between water pumps, heat exchangers, and steam turbines.

* Heat exchangers will consume exactly 100 water instead of ~103
* Steam turbines will produce 6 MW of power instead of 5.82 MW
* The ideal ratio is 5 turbines : 3 heat exchangers, instead of 500 : 291

One side effect is that your heat pipes may need to be marginally shorter, as the heat exchanger must reach a slightly higher temperature in order to produce steam.

You can change the steam temperature in the mod settings if you want to see how it affects things.  It must be below 1000 ⁰C, and the hotter you go, the shorter your heat pipes need to be.
